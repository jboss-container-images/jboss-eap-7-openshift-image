== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  |Name | Description

.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}`
|8080 | --
.1+| The web server's http port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-ping`
|8888 | ping
.1+| The JGroups ping port for clustering.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-tcp`
|61616 | --
.1+| The broker's OpenWire port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq-mesh`
|61616 | mesh
.1+| Supports node discovery for mesh formation.
|=============



=== Routes

A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-reachable hostname such as `www.example.com`. A defined route and the endpoints
identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide named connectivity from external clients to your applications. Each route consists
of a route name, service selector, and (optionally) security configuration. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/networking/routes.html[Openshift documentation] for more information.

=== Build Configurations

A `buildConfig` describes a single build definition and a set of triggers for when a new build should be created.
A `buildConfig` is a REST object, which can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance. Refer to
the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/builds/index.html#defining-a-buildconfig[Openshift documentation]
for more information.

=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/deployments/how_deployments_work.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}` | ImageChange
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-amq` | ImageChange
|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-migration` | ImageChange
|============



==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.

information.

=== External Dependencies


==== Volume Claims

A `PersistentVolume` object is a storage resource in an OpenShift cluster. Storage is provisioned by an administrator
by creating `PersistentVolume` objects from sources such as GCE Persistent Disks, AWS Elastic Block Stores (EBS), and NFS mounts.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html#overview[Openshift documentation] for
more information.

[[clustering]]
==== Clustering

Clustering in OpenShift EAP is achieved through one of two discovery mechanisms:
KUBE_PING or DNS_PING. This is done by configuring the JGroups protocol stack in
standalone-openshift.xml with any of the following mechanisms:
`<kubernetes.KUBE_PING>`, `<dns.DNS_PING>`, `<openshift.KUBE_PING/>` or
`<openshift.DNS_PING/>`. The templates are configured to use `DNS_PING`, however
`KUBE_PING` is the default used by the image.

The discovery mechanism used is specified by the `JGROUPS_PING_PROTOCOL` environment
variable which can be set to `openshift.DNS_PING`, `kubernetes.KUBE_PING`,
`dns.DNS_PING` or `openshift.KUBE_PING`. `KUBE_PING` is the default used
by the image if no value is specified for `JGROUPS_PING_PROTOCOL` for compatibility
with previous releases.

WARN: `openshift.DNS_PING` and `openshift.KUBE_PING` are deprecated and may be removed
in a future release.

For `DNS_PING` to work, the following steps must be taken:

. The `OPENSHIFT_DNS_PING_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable must be set to the
  name of the ping service for the cluster (see table above).  If not set, the
  server will act as if it is a single-node cluster (a "cluster of one").
. The `OPENSHIFT_DNS_PING_SERVICE_PORT` environment variables should be set to
  the port number on which the ping service is exposed (see table above).  The
  `DNS_PING` protocol will attempt to discern the port from the SRV records, if
  it can, otherwise it will default to 8888.
. A ping service which exposes the ping port must be defined.  This service
  should be "headless" (ClusterIP=None) and must have the following:
.. The port must be named for port discovery to work.
.. It must be annotated with `service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints`
   set to `"true"`.  Omitting this annotation will result in each node forming
   their own "cluster of one" during startup, then merging their cluster into
   the other nodes' clusters after startup (as the other nodes are not detected
   until after they have started).

        service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints: "true"
        description: "The JGroups ping port for clustering."
----

For `KUBE_PING` to work, the following steps must be taken:

For `kubernetes.KUBE_PING`:
. The `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` environment variable must be set (see table above).
  If not set, the server will act as if it is a single-node cluster (a "cluster of one").
. The `KUBERNETES_LABELS` environment variables should be set (see table above).
  If not set, pods outside of your application (albeit in your namespace) will try to join.

For legacy `openshift.KUBE_PING`
. The `OPENSHIFT_KUBE_PING_NAMESPACE` environment variable must be set (see table above).
  If not set, the server will act as if it is a single-node cluster (a "cluster of one").
. The `OPENSHIFT_KUBE_PING_LABELS` environment variables should be set (see table above).
  If not set, pods outside of your application (albeit in your namespace) will try to join.

For both implementations:
. Authorization must be granted to the service account the pod is running under to be
  allowed to access Kubernetes' REST api. This is done on the command line.
